StaySure: Hotel Price Prediction &amp; Booking Analysis System is a data-driven project developed to assist hotel staff in making smarter operational decisions. 


StaySure: Hotel Price Prediction & Analysis System – Project Highlights

Data Cleaning: Raw booking data was cleaned to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and noise, ensuring high-quality inputs for analysis and model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth EDA was performed to uncover patterns and relationships within the data, supporting business insights and model understanding.

Guest Origin Analysis: Identified the geographic distribution of guests to help hotels understand market reach and tailor marketing strategies region-wise.

Price Per Night Insights: Analyzed how much guests typically pay per room per night, helping in setting competitive and dynamic pricing strategies.

Seasonal Pricing Trends: Studied how hotel room prices vary throughout the year, enabling seasonal price optimization and forecasting.

Monthly Sorting and Analysis: Sorted and analyzed booking data by month to identify demand fluctuations and trends over time.

Identifying Busiest Months: Determined peak booking months, allowing hotels to better manage inventory, staffing, and promotional campaigns.

Guest Stay Duration Analysis: Measured how long guests typically stay to aid in resource planning and service customization.

Feature Encoding: Converted categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for model training using techniques like label encoding and one-hot encoding.

Outlier Detection and Handling: Detected and managed outliers to prevent skewed analysis and improve model performance.

Data Splitting and Model Building: Divided the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model accuracy and ensure robust performance.

Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented:

Logistic Regression for binary predictions like cancellation likelihood.

Naive Bayes for probabilistic classification tasks.

Random Forest and Decision Tree for predictive modeling with feature importance analysis.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification based on guest similarity.

Business Value: The model helps hotel staff optimize pricing, manage workforce efficiently, prevent fraud, and reduce last-minute cancellation impacts—making it a practical tool for the hospitality industry.
